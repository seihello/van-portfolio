          Hello, I'm Seisuke. I have over 5 years of experience in the software development area, and contributed to enhancement of the productivity in the semiconductor industry. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to add a range of capabilities to my repertoire, including coding in C++, system-designing, and testing. Those are just a few to name.<br />
          Along the way, I realized that I have a passion for creating efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly systems. My strengths are this passion and being hard-working. I aim to carry my past experiences forward, while continuing to grow.
